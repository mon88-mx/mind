# mind

Not a fan of blogs nor social networks, yet I find value in writing my thoughts because that is one good way to train the skill of writing.
So what is on my mind today?

I am practicing a silly approach to recurse a graph, going back to the basics training with trees and finding out ubuntu nowadays installs faster using the WSL extension than on top of virtualbox, which kind of makes me happy, I think Windows is a mess but a brearable one when the alternative is Oracle's big ego.

A thought I just can't put out of my head lately: living in Silicon Valley slowly extinguishes my enthusiasm for technology.

Today's lesson was about golang... it used to be always an annoying task to try to learn go because eventually I just lose it. This time feels different. Like the language is finally there, where it is solid but welcoming too. This is just a start for a learning journey that I might not complete, but this time at least feels better; no more odd references to github repositories, no more odd manipulation of bytes. This brings me kind of to my struggle with life in here and how things roll, making things fast and deliver whatever, not sure why or how is that good to anyone but to the few chasing a contract, a sale, a promo... simply put, in my opinion there is no substitute to good craftmanship; measuring impact on how many persons use my shit vs. how many persons benefit from my work is a weak argument, but weak is what's out there.
