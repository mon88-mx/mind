# mind

Not a fan of blogs nor social networks, yet I find value in writing my thoughts because that is one good way to train the skill of writing.
So what is on my mind today?

I am practicing a silly approach to recurse a graph, going back to the basics training with trees and finding out ubuntu nowadays installs faster using the WSL extension than on top of virtualbox, which kind of makes me happy, I think Windows is a mess but a brearable one when the alternative is Oracle's big ego.

A thought I just can't put out of my head lately: living in Silicon Valley slowly extinguishes my enthusiasm for technology.
