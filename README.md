# repo thoughts

Not a fan of blogs nor social networks, yet I find value in writing my thoughts because that is one good way to train the skill of writing.
So what is on my mind today?

I am practicing a silly approach to recurse a graph, going back to the basics training with trees and finding out ubuntu nowadays installs faster using the WSL extension than on top of virtualbox, which kind of makes me happy, I think Windows is a mess but a brearable one when the alternative is Oracle's big ego (vbox).

A thought I just can't put out of my head lately: living in Silicon Valley slowly extinguishes my enthusiasm for technology.

Today's lesson was about golang... it used to be always an annoying task to try to learn go because eventually I just lose it. This time feels different. Like the language is finally there, where it is solid but welcoming too. This is just a start for a learning journey that I might not complete, but this time at least feels better; no more odd references to github repositories, no more odd manipulation of bytes. This brings me kind of to my struggle with life in here and how things roll, making things fast and deliver whatever, not sure why or how is that good to anyone but to the few chasing a contract, a sale, a promo... simply put, in my opinion there is no substitute to good craftmanship; measuring impact on how many persons use my shit vs. how many persons benefit from my work is a weak argument, but weak is what's out there.

Words that shut off my brain during a conversation:

* democratize
* slice and dice
* unicorn
* faang

Don't fear using stacks... this is something for me to remember, just got to solve an issue that required a map except the map was not useful but for sorting pairs that if used a stack would spare me 3 iterations making my problem linear. Lesson learned?

How fast the world is going to shit, yet here we are, trying to cope with the changes and the ups and downs. Nothin new or exciting to say, I have become more accustmed with doing things fast and choosing more sophisticated ways to write code and address tasks, but well, that is just not luring more projects, just sparing me time. I was recently approached with recruiters asking me to join fintechs, yes, in 2023 there's still people who think that's a breakthrough, what's worse is using as introduction: "founded by ex-google employees", like that granted you the ability walk on the water. The only thing that tells me is they passed a "hard" interview... so exciting.

Just got rejected from another process. Well I thought I did well except I did not, what did I do wrong? In my opinion: Being honest. Often times people want right answers more than the real ones that have everything in them but right because right is not real, is ideal and ideals only execute well in our minds until experience catches up.
I am glad I got rejected, I am glad I am beyond these worlds where code golf and answering what was written down in a 10 year old book is the golden rule of how not to be an engineer, because engineers solve problems, sometimes efficiently, sometimes poorly but they are problem solvers to the core. Nobody deserves half a mill for moving things to k8s or for knowing how to reverse a binary tree in scala.

Another year is almost gone and must said I learned a lot this time, but I did not which by itself is a good lesson. Introspective tells me I have wasted time, doing some but could have done more, I come to this realization because often times in this environment it just feels like we are experts in nothing and feel like we would give great insight if only we were given the chance, then we are complacient of that chance not coming and waiting for it but there lies the flaw; often times those who might can and know less actually get farther and not because they had more skills, it is just a matter of doing more. So, note to myself, do more, try more, expect more.
